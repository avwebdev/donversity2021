In the bsu we hope to create a safe space to share our experiences, bond through events like the black college expo, discussions, and our African culture. It’s a place to spend time together, talk about our history, current events, and anything on the students minds.\n\nThis year we joined forces with the foothill bsu to widen our bsu community in Pleasanton and we hope to keep the relationship and keep working together. We also hope to connect with other schools in the bay area doing other black student summits as we did one earlier this year.\n\nWe even did an outreach helping our broader community by feeding the homeless at a presbyterian church in Castro Valley by cooking and serving the meal to the shelter they have there. We cooked a meat sauce with pasta, soup, bread, and brought muffins, yogurt, and fruit for breakfast the next day. We hope to continue doing this in the next year.",
