  - name: Black Student Union
    description: |-
      We as a black student Union strive to bring the black students on the Amador campus together. In the bsu we hope to create a safe space to share our experiences, bond through events like the black college expo, discussions, and our African culture. It’s a place to spend time together, talk about our history, current events, and anything on the students minds.

      This year we joined forces with the foothill bsu to widen our bsu community in Pleasanton and we hope to keep the relationship and keep working together. We also hope to connect with other schools in the bay area doing other black student summits as we did one earlier this year.

      We even did an outreach helping our broader community by feeding the homeless at a presbyterian church in Castro Valley by cooking and serving the meal to the shelter they have there. We cooked a meat sauce with pasta, soup, bread, and brought muffins, yogurt, and fruit for breakfast the next day. We hope to continue doing this in the next year.

      Our Neuroscience club connects students with peers who have a passion about understanding the complexities and intricate functions of the brain. The club is split into groups that research various neuroscience topics and share their discoveries with members about the relationship between our brain, our thoughts, and our behavior.

      Our bi-weekly meeting offers club members the opportunity to read scientific literature and research about newsworthy developments in the field of neuroscience. Meetings end with a fun Kahoot to win boba for each presentation topic!

      We’re trying to apply what we’ve learned about neurological diseases by developing an iOS app to help patients with dementia track their symptoms, which is scheduled to be finished and released in the summer of 2021!

      Anyone with a curiosity about the brain and hoping to find ways to help yourself, your friends, your loved ones, or your community is welcome to join us!
