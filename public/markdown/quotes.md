> For me, Donversity means empowering and inspiring people to celebrate their identity and inviting all students and staff to come together in fellowship and unity.

> I feel blessed to be part of a community that is rich in so many different cultures. Our multitude of backgrounds enhances our learning and opens our eyes up to the world outside of Pleasanton. This week gives us a moment to slow down and recognize that, celebrating all that we are. We are a community of one, Dons. There is no place I would rather be!

> Donversity (and diversity) means quite a lot to me.  Being a person of mixed-race myself (half-Asian and half-White), it makes me so glad to see that we are focusing on not only the benefits of having a diverse student population at Amador but also opening the discussion on issues like race and culture to a larger degree, that actively includes thoughts and discussions of our students.  These are challenging times we are living, for everyone, and we can all do our part in helping foster an inclusive environment both on our campus, and the larger community within Pleasanton, by being open to  uncomfortable discussions with each other.  It is only through opportunities for open dialogue, sharing of ideas, and considering others' viewpoints on issues like race (despite feelings of ambivalence to doing so) that we can truly rise above and live up to our American Ideals of equality, rights, liberty, opportunity, and democracy.

> I love the diversity we see on our campus! Our cultural and identity differences are what make us strong as a school as well as a nation. It's important that we see and appreciate these differences AND understand that these are what bring us together as Dons and as Americans. I'm so grateful to teach here and to be a part of our beautiful, diverse school and nation. We are definitely better together!
